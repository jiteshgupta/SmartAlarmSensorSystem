# SmartAlarmSensorSystem

The aim of the project was to create a network of remotely controlled sensors to alert the user in case of home intrusion.

We Developed a secure, scalable and multi-functional android application which can either act as a Sensor for sending phone's data to the server or Receiver to receive generated alert data. The communication between the applications was done using a web server hosted on Raspberry Pi having FTP and MySQL support to maintain user accounts. 

Moreover, we also implemented the sensor status and alert system on the Pebble watch.
